gitprint.com
============

Ever found that printing README's or Markdown files from Github.com is a pain in the ass? Me too.

The trick:
----------

Simply view any markdown file on Github, then in your URL bar replace the *github.com* part of the URL with *gitprint.com*. Your markdown file will be rendered to a beautiful, printable PDF.

TODO List:
----------

* Private repo printing
* Chrome extension to add print button into GitHub markdown views
